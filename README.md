# My Portfolio: My Mind's Kaleidoscope

Personal Portfolio is a project designed using plain web technologies: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project mimics a **Single Page Application (SPA)** with routing between pages. It features a drag-and-drop API, incorporating **drag-and-drop** in multiple innovative ways, including a terminal-like setup in developer mode. Leveraging the power of JavaScript, this portfolio showcases my projects and blogs, all presented with a sleek and engaging **UI design**.

Check out my portfolio presentation that I created with Apple Keynote (presentation software).

- HTML, CSS, JS, and Netlify (Hosting).
